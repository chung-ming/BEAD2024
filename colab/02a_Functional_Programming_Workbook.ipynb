        "However, there's a quicker way to write functions on the fly, and these are called lambda functions. A lambda function is a small anonymous function. A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. To create a lambda expression, we type in the keyword lambda, followed by the inputs. Next, we enter a colon, followed by the expression that will be the return value.\n",
